/*
 * Calling Extensions API
 *
 * Provides a way for apps to add custom calling options to a contact record. This works in conjunction with the [Calling SDK](#), which is used to build your phone/calling UI. The endpoints here allow your service to appear as an option to HubSpot users when they access the *Call* action on a contact record. Once accessed, your custom phone/calling UI will be displayed in an iframe at the specified URL with the specified dimensions on that record.
 *
 * API version: v3
 * Generated by: Swagger Codegen (https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git)
